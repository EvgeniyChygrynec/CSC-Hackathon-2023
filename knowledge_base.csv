Or admin can set phone settings for each user manually.   Control sending capacity and other limitsGo to Settings → Platform Settings → Sequences →  Limits . Enforced limits to the number of [RE Sequence emails](../Create-new-sequence/email_type_of_a_step) sent by RG users. Number of sequence email/sms touches an RG user can send per day  To prevent SPAM generation, most email services impose a limitation on the number of emails a user (or automated emailing software) can send through a single email account per specific period of time. The applied limit is 1 email sent per 1 minute. When Revenue Grid sends out emails, both custom written by a user and automated ones, it respects this limitation, observing the one minute minimum interval between sending emails. The recommended (default) value of this setting is 500 emails; this value approximates the maximum number of emails that can be sent over a standard working day's span with a one minute interval. It is the emails quantity ""bandwidth"" shared by all email sequences you run in RG.   When the limit is reached, all remaining automated emails have to be postponed to the following day's sending span defined by the Sequence's Schedule, regardless of the step's actual timeline. Therefore, please consider this standard limit of 500 emails/day per RG user when planning your emailing campaigns. The maximum value that can be set for this parameter is 1000, that is approximately 17 hours of automated emailing per 24 hours. If you do  not  set a limited daily Schedule for the Sequence (for example to imitate emails sending by a real person)  that is emails sending will be allowed for 24 hours, this increased limit is easily attainable, since the automated emails are sent out by your email server.    Important  In a realistic common case scenario a single RG user can send out around 100 emails per working day; this number is defined by his/her capability to process the recipient's responses to these emails. However, a informative mass email campaign that requires no specific response can make use from the maximum emailing ""bandwidth"".    Please note that there is also another factor that defines individual emails dispatching patterns, the Schedule idle parameter  set for Sequence steps   Number of sequence call, misc and signal steps scheduled per day Set the limit to number of automatic or manual steps of these types that can be scheduled per user per day.  Sequence touches limit per email domain per day Set the limit of touches per specific domain to avoid overwhelming a certain company with your outreaches.  Sequence touches limit per prospect per day ​The number of RG sequence emails allowed to be sent to a prospect per 24 hours. This parameter is set depending on the essence of the campaign and the target auditory. Normally the maximum number of such emails should not exceed 5, not to get a prospect annoyed. Note that this number does not include extra ""custom"" emails message composed by a RG user, for example a reaction to a prospect's reply or a follow-up clarifying a previously sent email. This parameter's default value is 5 and the maximum value is 10.  Sequence touches limit per prospect per week This parameter is similar to the above one, only it sets the RG sequence emails limit imposed over a period of one week. This parameter's default value is 10 and the maximum value is 20.  Active sequences per prospect How many active sequences a user can have at the same time.     Customize status mapping to SalesforceGo to Setting →  Sequences under Platform Settings  →  Status mapping  subtab. On this tab, Admins can  map Prospect statuses  to any value of any field in Salesforce for seamless mirroring, as well as  create additional Prospect statuses  tailored for any possible business need. Updates on this tab will get applied to all users in an Organization. By default, you get these Person statuses mapped to following values of the selected Salesforce fields (see the picture below).    Manage sending schedules  Go to Settings →  Sequences under Platform Settings  →  Schedules  subtab. On this tab you can create and manage email send-out schedules which you use in [RE Sequence](../Sequences/).    A schedule is a set of specific days of the week and daily time intervals (set in the prospect's Time zone retrieved from Salesforce) used in RG Sequences. Automated emails sent by Revenue Grid will only be dispatched on these days and within these time intervals. If you wish to exclude automated emails sending on the dates which are public holidays in the USA, you need to select the checkbox  Exclude federal US Holidays  in the schedule creation/editing dialog.  The schedules you select for your [sequence steps](../Sequences/) are overridden by [wait intervals set for individual steps](../Create-new-sequence/email_type_of_a_step).For example, if you create a sequence consisting of steps scheduled for every other day of the week except weekends (that is 3 sequence emails per business week) and set the wait interval between the steps to two days, the steps will be performed with a two day long interval (that is 2 sequence emails per business week). At the same, if the schedule implies sending one email per week, a two day long wait interval between steps will be always observed, not affecting the sending schedule.   Manage signals   Go to Settings →  Signals  subtab. This setting is available to Managers only. Here you can select which signals to run company-wide. Once a signal is disabled, already generated signals of that type will not disappear from the interface until resolved.    Manage all users   Go to Settings →  Users  subtab. On this tab, Admins can see company-wide Revenue Grid users, their: • Names • Emails • Who are their delegates (if any) • What is their  Dial-out and Texting  phone numbers (if any) to perform  SMS  and  Phone call  types of steps  • and Role (Admin or a regular User)     By clicking on a user, Admins can see their  Account tab , where they can set up delegates, select SMS and Voice numbers, grant admin rights, and set up Primary signature.

In such cases, the queue gets shifted and such email cuts the line to get sent out on demand. Another factor affects queuing is  email bandwidth limits .      For example, if you hit the limit of  ""Number of sequence touches a RG user can send per day"" , then the rest of the steps will be sent out not necessarily on the flowing calendar day, but on the following day within sequence's  delivery schedule .     ⚠️ And there will be a  special indicator  for queued prospects appearing in the  Next step  column on the  Recipients  and  Audience  tabs.      To sum up, the algorithm considers every email's priority, your and your company's  email bandwidth limits  and a  Sequence's   delivery schedule , and as an output, builds the most optimized queue to distribute outreaches.  Copy link to this question      28\. How to create a sequence which sends emails only on Thursday?Say you need a sequence of three emails to get sent on Thursdays only. The first email on the upcoming Thursday, the second on the following Thursday in a week, and the third email on the Thursday coming after that. Follow these steps in order to set up such a sequence to reach out your prospects only on a certain day of a week.       1. First, you have to have a  Delivery Schedule  which would be set only to that particular day of the week.              Go to Settings -> Schedule         Click    in the top right-hand corner.         Create the schedule.         Read more about  creating a schedule .             2. Next, make sure you select this schedule when  creating a sequence .           Also you can change an existing sequence's delivery schedule on the  Sequence's settings tab .             3. Now, it's time to create the 1st steps of the sequence.          For the first step, make sure you select 0 days in the  Schedule Idle  field. That way, the Sequence will start sending the first outreach on the closest upcoming Thursday.          4. When creating the 2nd and the 3rd steps though, it's very important to set 1 day in the  Schedule Idle  field.          If you keep the field at 0, then all 3 emails may get sent out on the same Thursday, and that's what you want to avoid.         You can modify the value even for the existing steps. Just double click the step on the  Overview tab  of the sequence, and update the field in  the bottom right-hand corner of the editor .        Copy link to this question      29\. What folders in an email client get synced with Revenue Grid?By default, emails only from  Inbox  and  Sent  folders of an email client get captured by Revenue Grid. But by a quick request to our Support team, you can easily have any sub-folder to get synced with Revenue Grid.  Copy link to this question  "
<," Salesforce Forecast Categories and Opportunity Stages       Standard Salesforce forecast categories A forecast category is a category that is assigned to an opportunity based on its opportunity stage. The forecast categories help sales representatives and managers to navigate through their sales process in the current sales period. They ensure better visibility and performance monitoring.    Salesforce forecast categories  are the baseline for [Revenue Grid reports](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/Reports-tab/) and [forecasts](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/forecast-table/) which are intended to ensure higher sales visibility and more customized projections. Thus, proper configuration of forecast categories and opportunity stages is an essential prerequisite for the seamless use of Revenue Grid functionality.  The standard Salesforce forecast categories are:   Pipeline  – The sum of opportunities that are in the early stages of the sales process.           Best Case  – The sum of opportunities that may be won by the end of the current period, given the ideal sales process scenario.           Commit  – The sum of opportunities that are going well and are likely to be won during the current period           Omitted  – The opportunities that were closed with the “lost result”. This figure is omitted in the forecasts.           Closed  – The sum of the Opportunities that were closed won during the current period.    Opportunity StagesForecasts are built based on the mapping between the Opportunity Stage and the Forecast Category. You can customize the mapping between the Opportunity Stage and the Forecast Category to ensure that it accurately reflects the sales process in your company.  Here is the example of a standard Salesforce stage mapping:       !!! tip ""Tip""    Opportunities stages and categories must be mapped reasonably to ensure that your team can benefit from using RG reports and forecasts. For example, if all stages from 10% to 90% fall within the Pipeline category in your company's mapping, it's recommended to change the mapping to match your company's actual sales cycle.  How to change stage mapping for forecast categories If necessary, you can change the mapping between Opportunity Stages and the Forecast Categories. To do that:   1.  In Sales Console, switch to  Opportunity  in Navigation Menu        2.  Click the  Gear  (Setup Menu) icon in the upper right corner of the page       3.  Select  Edit Object       4.  Go to  Fields & Relationships     5.  On the list, find  Stage   6.  Scroll down to  Opportunity Stages Picklist Values   7.  Click  Edit  next to the Stage to change its mapping.            Or click  New  to create a new stage      8.  You can change the percentage for the stage, forecast category for the stage, and add a description     9. Click  Save  to apply the changes      "

For this reason, we adhere to the following basic principles to protect customer data:   We never share our customers' personal or business data with third parties   Revenue Grid never stores any of your Salesforce or MS Exchange/Office 365/Gmail data, such as contacts, emails, calendar items, etc. The relevant data is only discreetly transferred through the cloud app, temporarily cached in [secure MS Azure servers'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview) memory and is never written to any persistent storage nor transferred outside of the established secured infrastructure. Essential exceptions to this principle:       What data is temporarily cached for logging purposes by Revenue Inbox: 1\. [identifiers](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000004383&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&type=1) and last modified dates of the records processed by [Revenue Inbox sync](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/SmartCloud-Connect-Synchronization-An-Overview/); 2\. the names of records with which the Sync engine had issues, solely to indicate them to the end users and Admins in [sync error notifications](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/Handling-Sync-Issues/); 3\. [Revenue Inbox Meetings Scheduler](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)/) temporarily keeps specified slots and spans to build selection tables for the recipients.       Unlike Revenue Inbox, Revenue Grid has to store specific customer and communication data which is required for performing its sales engagement and communication automation functions: the users' email correspondence history and contacts imported from Salesforce are securely and discretely kept on Revenue Grid's MS Azure servers.       No automatic Revenue Inbox customers opt-ins into Revenue Grid are performed; the customers must agree to the additional Revenue Grid Privacy Policy clauses before switching.         Any personally identifiable information which gets transferred through our servers is secured with industry standard protocols and encryption technologies; more on this below.See also: [RevenueGrid.com Privacy Policy](https://revenuegrid.com/privacy-policy/).

Detailed overview of Revenue Grid Prospect Statuses," Revenue Grid Prospect Statuses         Every prospect in Revenue Grid is assigned a certain Person Status based on their reaction to Sequence steps. The life-cycle of statuses start from  Just Added , once a prospect gets imported into Revenue Grid. Prospect status updates can be:- automatic, triggered by a [Sequence stage change](../Sequences-Stages/)- initiated by users on Revenue Grid side on [Action Center](../Planner/), [Audience](../People/), [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/)- or initiated by users on Salesforce side and get reflected on Revenue Grid side automatically according to [custom mapping](../Prospect-Statuses/custom_salesforce_mapping)!!! tip ""Tip""    If you do not want prospect's Revenue Grid status to get updated automatically when a Sequence [proceeds to its next stage](../Sequences-Stages/), clear the ""Update Person status on Sequence Stage Change"" checkbox in the [Sequence's settings](../Settings-of-Sequences). That is useful, for example, if running a secondary nurturing [email Sequence](../Create-new-sequence/).------ Default types of Person statusesJust added  - prospect has been added to [Audience page](../People/) but it's not involved in any Sequences yet.Not contacted  - this status indicates that a prospect has been added to a sequence, but no outreach has been made yet.Approaching - prospect engagement is in progress, going through the [steps](../Create-new-sequence/adding_and_editing_steps_toof_a_sequence) according to the sequence schedule.On hold - this status is assigned manually by a RG user. Such prospect will not proceed to a following step within any Sequences enrolled.Success - this status is assigned manually by a RG user by clicking ""Finish: Success"" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). This status means that the engagement was successful, thus sequence will not reach out to this prospect anymore and further negotiations will take place outside of Revenue Grid.Not interested  - this status is assigned manually by a RG user by clicking ""Finish: Not interested"" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/) when a prospect expresses his/her disinterest in this campaign. However, this prospect can still be contacted in a course of other campaigns.Opted Out - this status can be assigned both, manually or automatically. Manually by a RG user by clicking ""Finish: Opt Out"" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/mass_actions), on the [profile page](../People/contactlead_profile), or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). Also it may happen automatically if a prospect clicks [the unsubscribe link](../Settings/unsubscribe_links) in a received email.Bounced - this status is also can be assigned both, manually or automatically. Manually via [RG Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). Automatically, if a [hard bounce](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hard-bounce) delivery failure notification was received in response to a [Sequence email](../Create-new-sequence/email_type_of_a_step), then Revenue Grid will change this prospect's status to Bounced; in addition, the delivery failure automatic email will be put to the [Notifications](../Notifications/) tab in the Action Center. !!! tip ""Note""    If a prospect has Bounced status, then it's not going to be possible to Opt out the prospect anywhere throughout Revenue Grid. Whether on [Audience](../People/mass_action), [Prospect's Profile page](../People/contactlead_profile), [Recipients](../Recipients/mass_actions) tabs nor via the [Sidebar](../Sidebar).Unresponsive - this prospect status is automatically assigned if there has been no response from a prospect to [automated email sequence messages](../Create-new-sequence/email_type_of_a_step) for 1 week. In this case either another communication channel should be used or another lead from the same company should be engaged. If a prospect responds some time later, the status can be updated to Success, Not interested, or Opted out.    Custom Salesforce mapping to boolean or pick-list types of a fieldWhen a contact’s or a lead’s status changes in Revenue Grid, it may get reflected in Salesforce according to custom mapping. It also may work other way around; if a status changes directly in Salesforce, then it gets reflected in Revenue Grid. Custom mapping of Revenue Grid statuses to Salesforce depends on each company’s needs and business flow.   Here is an example how it works   Let's say you mapped an additional field (Rating) and its value (Warm), to the ""Approaching"" status. Explained: When a lead's Person status changes to Approaching in Revenue Grid, along with Salesforce field (Status) changing to ""Attempting to Contact"", also another Salesforce field (Rating) will get populated with corresponding value (Warm). And since the ""Bidirectional"" checkbox is selected, similarly the mirroring will happen other way around as well. If the field (Rating) of a lead gets changed to (Warm),  AND  in the field (Status) gets changed to ""Attempting to Contact"" in Salesforce, then the lead's Person status in Revenue Grid will be changed to ""Approaching"".      How to create a new custom Prospect status and map to a Salesforce field (boolean or pick-list types)Go to  Settings→Status mapping  8 steps  1. Choose what type of a status you want to add a new item to (you can add to Success or to Failed statuses, not to General ones)  2. Click ""New status"" button  3. Name you new status and click Confirm icon  4. Click ""New mapping"" button  5. Choose a Salesforce field (boolean or pick-list types)  6. Choose a value for that field to be populated once a prospect gets assigned the status  7. Press ""Save"" button on the bottom of the page 8. OPTIONAL: If you want the status to get mirrored bidirectionally, then select the corresponding checkbox.   When selected, not only the chosen field will be populated with the chosen value in Salesforce once a prospect is assigned the corresponding Person status, but other way around as well. Meaning, if the chosen value gets populated in Salesforce, then in Revenue Grid the prospect's status will be changed to the corresponding one.    Refer to this article for description of [Sequence stages](../Sequences-Stages/stages_of_sequences)."
Assignees selection strategies for Revenue Signals<," Select Assignees for Revenue Signals[ This is the article for Signals managers]       The assignees for most of Revenue Signals are predefined based on their relationship to Salesforce objects or activities (events, emails); however, some Signals feature advanced assignees configuration options (e.g. [Chosen conditions met for the Salesforce object](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/ri/fast/articles/signals-settings-and-parameters/1_chosen_conditions_met_for_the_salesforce_object)) when Revenue Grid admins can select the assignees who are to receive a specific Signal.

"Using Merge Fields️ while creating steps, templates and signature"," Using Merge Fields️ while creating steps, templates and signatures        While creating a mass-sent messages in Revenue Grid, make use of powerful rationalization feature — Merge Fields. It automatically inserts recipient-specific piece of data to email and SMS types of steps.  Merge field feature is available when:    - Adding a step to a Sequence  - Adding emails to CC field (because you can merge an email type of a field) - Building a template  - Building a signature  - Building an unsubscribe text   For example this is how merge-fielded email will look when you build it, and how your recipient will see it:   Insert a merge fieldIn order to insert a merge-field value:   1. Put a cursor where auto-inserted value should appear in the message  2. Type  {{  to see the drop-down with available variables you can choose from. Alternatively use  {{ }}  icon on the editor bar.  (insert  merge fields ) on the text editor toolbar  3. Choose what recipient-specific value you want to auto-insert into a mass email.   The value gets retrieved from Salesforce (recipient-specific data) or Revenue Grid (sender-specific data such as signature, campaign unsubscribe link, and more).   Commonly used merge-field examples: Lead/Contact Salutation, Full name and Company name, [RE Sequence](../Sequences/) starter's (Owner's) name and [RE email signature](../Settings/signatures), [sequence unsubscribe link](../Settings/the_unsubscribe_section), etc.   Note  When you use {{Sender Phone Number}} type of a merge field, Revenue Grid will pull sender's mobile number if available. In case if Mobile field is not populated, then it will show number set in Phone field.    Troubleshoot broken merge fields    To check a merge field's validity, you need to switch the editor to  Preview mode  (use tabs below the editor). Then, choose a recipient from ""To:"" field drop-down (if you haven't added recipients to the sequence yet, then ""To:"" field will show John Doe as a placeholder) whom you want to preview the end result for. In preview mode, invalid merge fields get highlighted with red color. While processing an email type of a Step, Revenue Grid checks whether all merge field's values are available. Some may not be available due to empty values in Salesforce, wrong syntactic, no API access etc. If a value is missing for a specific prospect, then an automated email containing it will not be sent to the prospect. Instead, it will be moved to [Action Center](../Planner/)'s To-Dos tab and hang on there until handled manually.  The best practice to fix it, is to populate the missing field (highlighted red) on the recipients' file in Salesforce. Otherwise, remove the merge field tag from the message.   Use If-Then-Else logic to replace missing fields with alternative values While personalizing a mass message, you should merge in a field from Salesforce. When a field is blank for a certain prospect though, utilize if-then-else expression. Example: Expected result: ""Dear John..."", or when name field is blank, simply ""Dear Customer..."". Regular expression: ""Dear {{Name}}..."" which will cause  Merge Field Issue  in cases when  Name  field is blank for a prospect. Go to the Action Center's To-do tab to fix such issue manually. Until you fix the issue, a prospect will hang on there and will not proceed to the next step of a Sequence. Smart expression: ""Dear {{if Name}}{{Name}}{{else}}Customer{{/if}}""    The most convenient way to use the smart expression is, type the """" symbol, and choose the value you want to insert.     Awesome Merge Field options:  Part of the day  merge field: Say you start your outreach with a greeting like ""Good {{part_of_the_day}}"", Revenue Grid will pull a value among ""morning"", ""afternoon"", or ""evening"" depending on when exactly the email is being sent off taking into consideration the recipient's time zone: ""morning"" – from 12 AM to 12 PM ""afternoon"" – from 12 PM to 4 PM ""evening"" – from 4 PM to 12 AM  Last step day  merge field: Use this merge field when you want to refer to the previous outreach within a sequence. It works best with Follow-up type of steps. Case use: You have an email type of a step which has been executed on the previous Thursday. The next step in the sequence can have this merge field and look like ""I emailed you on {{last_step_day}}, but never heard back."" The recipient will see this: ""I emailed you on Thursday, but never heard back."" Note that  Last step day  merge field will work only if the previous step was executed.  Book me link  merge field: Adds personal Book me link to the email. Depending on  whose behalf the sequence is being run , you can add {{Owner BookMe Text}} or {{Sender BookMe Text}}. Go to settings to  set up your personal Book me link .   Extra BookMe and Unsubscribe links   You can add extra book me or unsubscribe links to your email steps. Those links will be associated with the sequence, for complex link tracking and performance measurements.
